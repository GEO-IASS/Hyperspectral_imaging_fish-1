# Synopsis

The dataset contains hyperspectral images for of minnow fishes with the objective of investigating if freshness of
the fish can be estimated using hyperspectral imaging.


## Dataset description
* One fish was obtained and imaged on 8/6. Afterwards it were stored in the deep freeze

* The fish was defrosted and imaged on 9/6. The fish was subsequently stored in normal
cooling conditions

* The fish was defrosted and imaged on 12/6. 

## Measurements 
-For each case, a hyperspectral image of 25 bands was acquired in the wavelength 680-970nm. Individual bands are
stored in the Bands folder

-Then five different regions of the fish (shown in selection.tiff) were selected and the corresponding
spectral profile for each pixel was extracted.

-The extracted spectral profiles were stored as plots and in csv files (spectrum.tiff and vals_dayX.csv)
